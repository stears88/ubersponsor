# ubersponsor
USS UberSponSor is next generation sponsoring application for recovering alcoholics and addicts of any type. With the new social distance lifestyle, it may be hard for certain people recovering from alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc to find a good sponsor locally or in real life. This application will allow sponsee's to find an available sponsor to talk to via voice/video/text at that very moment they need one. This will help the people in recovery achieve their goals of another day sober/clean of their addiction. Sponsors will be paid by minute/text with Cryptocurrency 'USS' that will be funded through initial launch of token/coin/network. Sponsees will NOT have to pay anything for their immediate help, but will be able to purchase 'USSC' tokens to give clout to those who really helped. 'USSC' can be staked by the Sponsor/Sponsee to earn more and the more 'USSC' holdings a Sponsor has, the more they get paid per min/text. Using programmatic currency allows the free help to be there when it is needed therefore making the world a safer place from the havoc these addictions reap on themselves, loved ones and victims.
